## 📘 Project Overview

This interactive **Power BI** dashboard transforms HR data into actionable workforce insights. It visualizes attrition, employee demographics, job satisfaction, and education/department trends — enabling HR managers to target retention, hiring, and development strategies.

 

## 📊 Key KPIs (from dashboard)

- **Total Employees:** 398  
- **Attrition (Total):** 58  
- **Attrition Rate:** 14.57%  
- **Active Employees:** 340  
- **Average Age:** 39  

 

## 💡 Dashboard Highlights & Findings

- **Department-wise Attrition:** R&D shows the highest share of attrition (~55%), followed by Sales (~25%).  
- **Age Distribution:** Most leavers are in the **25–34** age band — consider targeted retention for early-career staff.  
- **Education & Attrition:** Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds show notable attrition counts (e.g., Life Sciences = 25).  
- **Job Satisfaction vs Role:** The satisfaction matrix reveals roles with lower satisfaction scores which align with higher churn.  
- **Gender & Age Insights:** Donut charts show attrition rate differences by gender across age groups — helpful for targeted interventions.
